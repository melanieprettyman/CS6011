Project Title: Multi-Platform Chat Application


* Project Description
   * This project is a multi-platform chat application consisting of a web server, web client, and Android app. The web server, implemented in Java, facilitates communication between clients using WebSockets. The web client is a simple HTML and JS web page that allows users to log in and participate in chat rooms. The Android app provides a native mobile experience for users to join chat rooms, send messages, and view chat history.
* Why You Used the Technologies You Used
   * Java: Used for the web server to handle WebSocket communication and manage chat rooms.
   * HTML and JS: Implemented a web client for users to access the chat application through a browser.
   * Android Studio (Java): Developed a native Android app to enhance user experience on mobile devices.
* Some of the Challenges You Faced
   * WebSocket Communication: Implementing WebSocket communication between the server and clients required careful handling of messages and synchronization to ensure a seamless chat experience.
   * Android UI Design: Designing a user-friendly interface for the Android app, including chat bubbles and message display, presented challenges in UI design and responsiveness.
* How to Use the Project
1. Set Up the Web Server: Open the Java project in your preferred IDE and run the server. Make sure to handle exceptions gracefully.
2. Access the Web Client:Open the index.html file in a web browser. Enter your username, choose a chat room, and start chatting.
3. Run the Android App:Open the Android project in Android Studio. Connect an Android device or use an emulator. Build and run the app on the device. Enter your username and choose a chat room. Send and receive messages in real-time.
